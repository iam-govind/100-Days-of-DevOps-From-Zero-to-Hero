🚀 Day 3/100 — Traditional Software Delivery vs DevOps

Today, I explored how software delivery works in a traditional setup compared with the DevOps approach.

In a traditional workflow, the process often moves through separate teams:

Development → Testing → Operations → Production

Each team completes its part and then hands the work to the next team.

The challenge is that more handoffs can mean more waiting, manual work, and opportunities for communication gaps.

I also learned why manual deployments can become difficult to manage.

A simple deployment might involve copying files, checking environments, updating configurations, and verifying the application. When these steps are repeated frequently, relying completely on memory and manual work can increase the chance of mistakes.

To understand this better, I did a small hands-on lab.

First, I manually deployed a simple application:

Application
    ↓
Staging
    ↓
Production

Then I created a Bash script to perform the same deployment steps automatically:

./deploy.sh

The script:

✅ Deployed the application to staging
✅ Verified the staging version
✅ Deployed it to production
✅ Verified the production version

I then updated the application from Version 1 to Version 2 and ran the same script again.

My biggest takeaway today:

DevOps is not about automating everything blindly. It is about improving collaboration and making repeated processes more reliable, consistent, and easier to manage.

One small step at a time, but the DevOps picture is becoming clearer. 🚀
