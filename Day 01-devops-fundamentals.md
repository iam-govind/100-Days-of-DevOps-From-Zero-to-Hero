# 🚀 Day 01/100 — What is DevOps?

Welcome to **Day 1** of my **100 Days of DevOps — From Zero to Hero** journey.

## 🎯 Objective

By the end of this lesson, I should understand:

* What DevOps is
* Why DevOps is important
* The difference between Development and Operations
* Core DevOps principles
* The DevOps lifecycle

---

## 🧠 What is DevOps?

**DevOps** is a combination of:

> **Development + Operations**

But DevOps is more than just combining two teams.

It is a culture and engineering approach focused on:

* 🤝 Collaboration
* ⚙️ Automation
* 🔄 Continuous Integration
* 🚀 Continuous Delivery
* 📊 Monitoring
* 🔁 Continuous Feedback
* 📈 Continuous Improvement

The main goal is to help teams **build, deliver, and operate software faster and more reliably**.

---

## 👨‍💻 Development vs Operations

Traditionally, software development and IT operations could work as separate teams.

### Development

Developers typically focus on:

* Writing application code
* Developing new features
* Fixing bugs
* Improving functionality

### Operations

Operations teams typically focus on:

* Managing servers
* Deploying applications
* Maintaining infrastructure
* Monitoring systems
* Ensuring availability
* Supporting production environments

This separation can sometimes create problems.

A classic example:

> 👨‍💻 Developer: **"It works on my machine!"**

> 🛠️ Operations: **"But it doesn't work in production!"** 😄

DevOps helps reduce this gap through **collaboration, shared responsibility, automation, and continuous feedback**.

# 🔄 DevOps Lifecycle

A simplified DevOps lifecycle is:

```text
Plan
  ↓
Code
  ↓
Build
  ↓
Test
  ↓
Release
  ↓
Deploy
  ↓
Operate
  ↓
Monitor
  ↓
Feedback
  ↺
```

The lifecycle is continuous.

```text
Plan → Code → Build → Test → Release → Deploy
                                      ↓
Feedback ← Monitor ← Operate
```

---

## 📌 DevOps Lifecycle Stages

### 1. Plan 📝

Decide what needs to be built.

Examples:

* Gather requirements
* Create tasks
* Prioritize features
* Plan releases

---

### 2. Code 💻

Developers write and modify the application code.

Example:

```html
<h1>Welcome to My DevOps Journey</h1>
```

Source code is commonly managed using version control tools such as Git.

---

### 3. Build 📦

The application is compiled, packaged, or prepared for execution.

Example:

```text
Source Code
    ↓
Build Process
    ↓
Application Artifact
```

---

### 4. Test 🧪

The application is tested to identify issues before deployment.

Examples include:

* Unit Testing
* Integration Testing
* Security Testing
* Performance Testing

---

### 5. Release 🏷️

A tested version of the application is prepared for deployment.

Example:

```text
Application v1.0
Application v1.1
Application v1.2
```

---

### 6. Deploy 🚀

The application is moved to an environment.

Typical flow:

```text
Development
     ↓
Staging
     ↓
Production
```

Deployment can be automated using CI/CD pipelines.

---

### 7. Operate ⚙️

The application and infrastructure are managed after deployment.

This may include:

* Server management
* Scaling
* Backups
* Security
* Availability
* Incident handling

---

### 8. Monitor 📊

Teams monitor the health and performance of applications and infrastructure.

Examples:

* CPU usage
* Memory usage
* Application errors
* Response time
* Availability
* Logs

---

### 9. Feedback 🔁

Information from users and monitoring is used to improve the application.

```text
User Feedback
      +
Monitoring Data
      ↓
Improvements
      ↓
Next Plan
```

Then the DevOps lifecycle begins again.

---

# ⭐ Core DevOps Principles

## 🤝 Collaboration

Development and Operations work together throughout the software lifecycle.

## ⚙️ Automation

Repeated tasks such as building, testing, and deployment can be automated.

## 🔄 Continuous Integration

Code changes are integrated frequently and validated through automated builds and tests.

## 🚀 Continuous Delivery

Applications are kept in a deployment-ready state.

## 📊 Monitoring

Applications and infrastructure are continuously observed for health and performance.

## 🔁 Continuous Feedback

Teams use feedback to identify problems and continuously improve.

# 💻 Hands-on Lab

## Step 1: Create the DevOps learning workspace

Open Terminal and run:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/devops-100-days
cd ~/devops-100-days
```

Verify your current directory:

```bash
pwd
```

Expected output:

```text
/Users/<your-username>/devops-100-days
```

---

## Step 2: Create the Day 1 notes file

Create a file:

```bash
touch day01-devops-fundamentals.md
```

Open it using your preferred editor and add the content from this lesson.

---

## Step 3: Create your project folders

Run:

```bash
mkdir -p labs notes projects screenshots
```

Check the directory:

```bash
ls -la
```

Expected structure:

```text
devops-100-days/
├── day01-devops-fundamentals.md
├── labs/
├── notes/
├── projects/
└── screenshots/
```

# 📚 Key Takeaways

Today I learned:

* DevOps means **Development + Operations**
* DevOps is not a single tool
* DevOps focuses on collaboration and shared responsibility
* Automation helps make repeated processes consistent
* The DevOps lifecycle is continuous
* Monitoring and feedback are important parts of software delivery

### 💡 My biggest takeaway

> **DevOps is not just about using tools like Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, or Terraform. It is a culture and engineering approach that combines collaboration, automation, continuous delivery, monitoring, and feedback.**
